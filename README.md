# Project Title: Hotel Reservation System with Java

## Description
The Hotel Reservation System is a Java application designed to automate the process of booking, managing, and cancelling hotel reservations. This system utilizes a two-dimensional array of strings where each row represents a room with details such as room ID, total price per night, and the name of the person who reserved it. An accompanying boolean array indicates whether a room is reserved. The application allows users to book or cancel rooms, check room availability, search for rooms by room number, and manage room details. Proper validation ensures that all user inputs are accurate and complete.

## What I Learned
- **Java Programming:**
  - Enhanced understanding of Java, including array manipulation and data handling.
  - Implemented logic for booking, cancelling, and searching reservations.

- **Data Structures:**
  - Utilized two-dimensional arrays to store and manage room information.
  - Integrated boolean arrays to efficiently track room availability.

- **User Input Validation:**
  - Developed robust input validation to ensure accuracy and completeness of reservation details.
  - Implemented error handling to manage invalid inputs and edge cases.

- **Modular Programming:**
  - Designed modular methods for booking, cancelling, and checking room availability.
  - Ensured code readability and maintainability through modular design.

- **Algorithm Development:**
  - Created algorithms to search and manipulate reservation data efficiently.
  - Developed logic to handle dynamic insertion and deletion of room records.

- **Problem-Solving:**
  - Applied problem-solving skills to design and implement features for managing hotel reservations.
  - Tackled challenges related to array manipulation and data consistency.

- **Testing and Debugging:**
  - Conducted thorough testing to verify the accuracy and reliability of the reservation system.
  - Debugged issues to ensure smooth functionality and user experience.

- **Version Control:**
  - Utilized Git for version control to track changes and manage code revisions.
  - Pushed the project to a GitHub repository, showcasing the project and facilitating collaboration.
